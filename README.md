`webcpr` *(W.I.P.)* is a tool that lets you use deprecated elements in your HTML
code, while not having to worry about browsers no longer supporting them. This
works sort of like an anti-polyfill: instead of making the functionality of new
browsers work in older browsers, it makes *deprecated* functionality work in
new browsers.
